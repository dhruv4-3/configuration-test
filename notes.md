# Conclusion

## Kustomize patching
Can be applied when there's a common patch which needs to be applied to the entire repo location, or specific to a name (although requires a lot of patch and target fields to be configured)

## Jsonnet 
Very helpful when we have to template out something with dynamic values.
(Will help in generating new "vpcendpoints" or other resources which might be added later)
